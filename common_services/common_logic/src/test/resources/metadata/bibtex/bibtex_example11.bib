	Abstract = {Issues relevant to the steering mechanism for
  object-oriented scientific computations are examined in
  this paper. The concept of computation steering is
  delineated, and its benefits are discussed based on
  past experiences with its application to scientific
  computations. Experiences of using an object-oriented
  scripting language called Python to steer C++
  applications are presented in further details. It is
  found that Python and C++ can be combined in an elegant
  way which combines the benefits of steering and the
  advantages of using an efficient object-oriented
  language for scientific modeling.},
