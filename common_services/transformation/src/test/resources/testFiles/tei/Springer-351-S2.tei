				<head>Abstract</head>
				<p>Due to being a virtually monomorphic wader species, migration dynamics and
					sex-related migration patterns in the Wood Sandpiper (<hi rend="italic">Tringa
						glareola</hi>) have rarely been investigated. We captured spring migrants at
					an important stopover site in northeastern Austria. Birds were individually
					color-marked, and sex was determined by an analysis of DNA from tail feather
					material. Among temporary residents (birds seen again after day of capture),
					males migrated on average 3 days earlier than females. However, since sexes did
					not differ in fat score, the length of stay and the proportion of transients
					(birds not seen again after day of capture) and temporary residents, we suggest
					that males and females adopt similar migration strategies in the spring. The
					large number of transients captured as well as shorter stopover durations in
					later temporary residents indicate that Wood Sandpipers minimize time at this
					stage of their northbound migration. Temporary residents earlier in the season
					exhibited lower fat stores than later ones. Nevertheless, since the fat stores
					of transients and temporary residents were similar even after the progress of
					the season had been accounted for, we assume that Wood Sandpipers may afford to
					exhibit individual flexibility in migration strategy and the use of stopover
					sites, especially early in the season. This variability may be a necessary
					adaptation to cope with possible varying environmental conditions at dynamic and
					unpredictable inland stopover sites. After having reached North Mediterranean
					regions, mean body mass of spring migrants gradually increases during successive
					stopovers, indicating that Wood Sandpipers follow a ‘hopping’ migration
					strategy. This emphasizes the high conservation value of even small artificial
					mudflat pools as important stepping stones in order to maintain a continuous
					network of wetland habitats for this continental migrant.</p>

				<head>Introduction</head>
				<p>The Wood Sandpiper <hi rend="italic">Tringa glareola</hi> is a common migrant in
					inland Central Europe (Kirchner <ref>1978</ref>) and found in abundance at
					freshwater habitats during its north- and southbound migration. In the course of
					their annual migratory journeys between sub-Saharan Africa and Fennoscandian
					breeding grounds, they depend on the availability of suitable stopover sites.
					Piersma (<ref>1987</ref>) hypothesized that waders follow either a ‘hop, skip or
					jump’ migration strategy. ‘Jumping’ is characterized by long flights and may
					involve as few as one stopover in-between. As such, jumpers need to put on and
					carry large fat loads for covering the long distances between stopovers. The
					‘skipping’ migration strategy involves a series of flight bouts with few stops,
					whereas ‘hoppers’ fly only short distances between numerous brief stopovers.
					Hopping is energetically less costly than performing long jumps or intermediate
					skips and entails lower risks of delays in fattening and timing (Piersma
						<ref>1987</ref>).</p>
				<p>Among waders, males generally precede females in the spring (Ketterson and Nolan
						<ref>1983</ref>), and the latter leave breeding grounds ahead of males and
					juveniles in many species (Glutz von Blotzheim et al. <ref>1986</ref>). As in
					all <hi rend="italic">Tringa</hi> species, female Wood Sandpipers are on average
					slightly larger than their male counterparts (Jehl and Murray <ref>1986</ref>;
					Remisiewicz and Wennerberg <ref>2006</ref>). However, due to being a virtually
					monomorphic species, sex-related differences in the migration dynamics of the
					Wood Sandpiper have rarely been investigated. Remisiewicz and Wennerberg
						(<ref>2006</ref>) recently used genetic analyses to reveal sex differences
					in the morphology and spring migration phenology of Wood Sandpipers in
					northeastern Poland. These researchers found that differential timing of
					migration occurred between sexes (males ahead of females) and age classes
					(second year birds after older birds). In the study reported here, we applied
					molecular sexing in order to examine sex-specific patterns in migration dynamics
					in the Wood Sandpiper at an important stopover site in northeastern Austria,
					which is further south along the spring migration route than that studied by
					Remisiewicz and Wennerberg (<ref>2006</ref>). Due to the small size and the
					openness of our study site, color-ringed birds can be easily detected (Wichmann
					et al. <ref>2004</ref>). Consequently, minimum stopover durations of migrants
					can be estimated quite precisely. Studies involving individual color-ringing
					therefore provide an ideal opportunity for more detailed investigations of
					migration dynamics in this locally abundant migrant species.</p>

			<div type="MaterialsAndMethods" xml:id="Sec2">
				<head>Methods</head>
				<div xml:id="Sec3">
					<head>Study area and field methods</head>
					<p>Our study site, the ‘Absetzbecken Hohenau-Ringelsdorf’ (48°35′N, 16°55′E), is
						located in northeastern Austria and consists of several small pools
						(‘Absetzbecken’, total area 38 ha) and a 17-ha pond (‘Kühlteich’) belonging
						to the local sugar factory. The site contains a mosaic of shallow water
						pools, semi-submerged vegetation and muddy areas (Wichmann et al.
							<ref>2004</ref>) and represents an important stopover site for waders in
						Austria (Zuna-Kratky and Rössler <ref>1993</ref>). The Wood Sandpiper is one
						of the most abundant wader species migrating through this area (Zuna-Kratky
						et al. <ref>2000</ref>).</p>
					<p>Spring migrants were caught with walk-in traps (Meissner <ref>1998</ref>)
						from 18 April until 12 May 2004 (4 days a week, 16 days in total) and from
						22 April until 17 May 2005 (7 days a week, 26 days in total). The captured
						birds were individually marked with metal and plastic color rings. The size
						of the visible fat deposits was determined according to a 0–8 scale
						developed by Kaiser (<ref>1993</ref>), which enables the detection of small
						differences in visible fat stores independent of absolute body size or mass
						fluctuations, such as those that occur during the course of day (Kaiser
							<ref>1993</ref>). We therefore used fat score as a direct measure of
						body condition (Green <ref>2001</ref>).</p>
					<p>During the trapping period, all Wood Sandpipers in the area were counted once
						a day for 5 days per week in 2004 and 7 days per week in 2005. We estimated
						the minimum length of stay by assuming that birds arrived on the day of
						initial capture and departed on the day when they were last observed.
						Color-ringed birds that were not seen again after the day of capture were
						assumed to have departed from the study site the day they were ringed. Since
						the stopover length of this latter group was classified as 0, we will refer
						to those birds as ‘transients’. Migrants seen again after the day of capture
						were defined as ‘temporary residents’.</p>
				</div>
				<div xml:id="Sec4">
					<head>Sex determination</head>
					<p>We used the feathers of ringed birds for sexing as feather bases provide a
						good source of DNA (Bayard de Volo et al. <ref>2003</ref>). Of the breast
						feathers collected during ringing in 2004 and stored in dry envelopes, only
						13 out of 28 samples were successfully sexed. Consequently, in 2005, tail
						feathers were collected and stored in 96% ethanol. Over the spring passage
						period, 71 individuals were randomly chosen, of which 67 were successfully
						sexed based on DNA extracted from the tail feathers.</p>
					<p>In birds, females carry two different copies of the sex chromosome (WZ),
						while males are homogametic (ZZ). This difference is employed in genetic sex
						determination. We used a PCR-based method to amplify sex-specific DNA
						fragments of CHD-gene located on the sex chromosomes (Griffiths and Tiwari
							<ref>1993</ref>, <ref>1995</ref>; Ellegren <ref>1996</ref>; Griffiths et
						al. <ref>1996</ref>). In the avian genome, the two copies of this gene
						(CHD-W and CHD-Z) differ in the lengths of their introns (Griffiths and Korn
							<ref>1997</ref>). We used primers P2 and P8 by Griffiths et al.
							(<ref>1998</ref>), which bind in the CDH gene at exon sequences flanking
						an intron that usually differs in length between W and Z copies. Hence, when
						the section of the CHD-gene including the length-variable intron is PCR
						amplified, the sexes can be distinguished by the presence of either (1) two
						bands showing two fragments of different lengths or (2) fragments of uniform
						length (males) constituting a single band on the electrophoresis gel. For
						the screening of total genomic DNA by PCR analysis, we extracted DNA from
						feathers using the DNA mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The amplification of
						PCR fragments was performed in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing PCR buffer
						with 1.5 mM MgCl<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 μM of
						each primer and 0.5 U of<hi rend="italic"> Taq</hi> polymerase (Amersham
						Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The PCR reaction conditions comprised an
						initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 15 s
						at 52°C, 50 s at 72°C and a final extension step of 7 min at 72°C. Negative
						and positive controls were included in all runs. All screens were repeated
						three times to verify the results. Amplified fragments were separated by
						length on a 2% agarose gel.</p>

				<div xml:id="Sec5">
					<head>Data analysis</head>
					<p>To determine intraspecific variation among spring migrant Wood Sandpipers, we
						examined differences in (1) all individuals and (2) temporary residents. We
						chose the latter for separate analyses because transient birds were assumed
						to have departed from the study area on the day of arrival and, therefore,
						did not actually use Hohenau as a stopover site. Since median dates of
						passage differed between study years (see <ref>Results</ref>), we
						investigated sex-related differences in the timing of migration by
						classifying the median date of passage of each study year as day 0.</p>
					<p>Statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA ver. 7.1 (StatSoft Inc
							<ref>2005</ref>). We used nonparametric and randomization tests if the
						assumptions, such as the normal probability distribution of data, could not
						be met. Randomizations were performed using the program MUREG (H.L.
						Nemeschkal, University of Vienna). Results were taken to be statistically
						significant if <hi rend="italic">P</hi> &lt; 0.05.</p>

					<p>The number of male Wood Sandpipers (47) migrating through the area exceeded
						the number of female migrants (33), but the difference was not significant
						(binomial test, <hi rend="italic">P</hi> = 0.15). Due to the low sample size
						of sex-determined individuals in 2004 (eight males, five females), we were
						unable to test whether the median dates of passage within either sex
						differed between the study years. However, the median date of passage of all
						birds captured did differ between years (2004: May 3, <hi rend="italic"

						both sexes (range April 25–May 17, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 211). Within
						temporary residents, the median date of passage differed between males

					<head>Use of stopover site and body condition</head>
					<p>Of the 211 first captures in both study years, 159 birds (73.5%) were

						(temporary residents). The number of temporary residents and transients did

					<p>Since stopover duration and fat score of the spring migrants did not differ

						Fat scores of spring migrants were similar between transients and temporary

						<hi rend="subscript">1,208</hi> = 0.01, <hi rend="italic">P</hi> = 0.914)

						<hi rend="subscript">1,208</hi> = 3.53, <hi rend="italic">P</hi> = 0.062).
						This result is founded on variations in fat deposits of the temporary

				<head>Discussion</head>
				<p>Birds traveling long distances are subject to severe physiological and ecological
					constraints and depend on suitable stopover sites for refuelling in order to
					complete their migration (e.g. Alerstam <ref>1993</ref>; Berthold
						<ref>1990</ref>). The exact timing of resource availability at the time of
					passage is critical to their survival. Timing is especially important during the
					spring, when resources must be available during a rather narrow time window.
					Unlike coastal staging sites, interior wetlands are dynamic and unpredictable
					habitats (Skagen and Knopf <ref>1993</ref>; Amezaga et al. <ref>2002</ref>). As
					such, waders travelling along an inland migration route need to be more flexible
					in their choice of stopover sites. This is reflected by the lower degree of site
					fidelity observed in continental migrants than in coastal shorebirds, with the
					latter being highly depend on the availability of traditional staging posts
					(Colwell and Oring <ref>1988</ref>; Skagen and Knopf <ref>1994</ref>).</p>
				<p>The spring phenology of Wood Sandpipers at our study site corresponds well with
					phenology patterns reported from other inland stopover sites (Winkler and
					Herzig-Straschil <ref>1981</ref>; Glutz von Blotzheim et al. <ref>1986</ref>;
					Leuzinger and Jenni <ref>1993</ref>; Scebba and Moschetti <ref>1996</ref>;
					Anthes et al. <ref>2002</ref>; Laber <ref>2003</ref>; Remisiewicz et al.
						<ref>2007</ref>). Differences in median dates of passage between years may
					have occurred due to shifting environmental conditions (Anthes <ref>2004</ref>)
					and/or varying catching efforts and periods. However, the numbers of migrant
					waders recorded in 2004 were overall low, both at Hohenau and at Austria’s most
					important stopover site for waders, the Seewinkel region in the southeastern
					part of the country (Zuna-Kratky <ref>2004</ref>). Considerable between-year
					variation in the spring migration intensity of Wood Sandpipers has also been
					reported recently for stopover sites in Poland and Belarus (Remisiewicz et al.
						<ref>2007</ref>). The tight timing of spring passage as well as the large
					number of transients suggest that Wood Sandpipers minimize their time during the
					northbound migration. While the median stopover duration of spring migrants at
					Hohenau was 4 days, the overall median length of stay at study sites in Poland
					and Belarus was 2 days (M. Remisiewicz, personal communication), indicating that
					the migration schedule becomes tighter as birds get closer to the breeding
					grounds (see references in Battley et al. <ref>2004</ref>).</p>
				<p>Since neither the number of transients and temporary residents nor the stopover
					duration differed between males and females, our data implies that sex-related
					differences in migration speed did not occur. Differences in fat stores could
					also not be detected between sexes. In northeastern Poland, Remisiewicz and
					Wennerberg (<ref>2006</ref>) found that adult (&gt;2nd year) males migrated
					ahead of females. That the same pattern applied only to temporarily resident
					birds in our study may be due to the fact that we did not distinguish between
					age classes. Our findings suggest that, except for differences in the timing of
					migration, males and females adopt similar migration strategies during the
					northbound migration. Differential migration with males preceding females is a
					commonly observed pattern among many bird species during the spring migration
					and may result from latitudinal segregation of sexes on the wintering grounds
					(Cristol et al. <ref>1999</ref>). In species in which sexes are not spatially
					segregated during the non-breeding season, male-biased earlier arrival on the
					breeding grounds (protandry) in migratory birds has primarily been attributed to
					(1) male–male competition for high-quality territories and (2) benefits arising
					from increased opportunities to mate (Morbey and Ydenberg <ref>2001</ref>). In
					the monogamous Wood Sandpiper, males establish breeding territories and females
					choose a mate among territorial males (Jehl and Murray <ref>1986</ref>;
					Remisiewicz and Wennerberg <ref>2006</ref>). Therefore, males should strive to
					reach the breeding grounds early in order to obtain high-quality territories.
					For females, however, it may be convenient to arrive at breeding sites after
					males to maximize the pool of available mates. The high overlap of biometric
					measurements between sexes (Remisiewicz and Wennerberg <ref>2006</ref>; own
					data, unpublished) may be one reason why only minor sex-specific differences in
					migration patterns could be detected. In wader species with a more pronounced
					sex dimorphism, the constraints acting on sexes and resulting in different
					migration patterns of males and females may be more important, as demonstrated
					for the European Bar-tailed Godwit <hi rend="italic">Limosa lapponica</hi>
					(Ketterson and Nolan <ref>1983</ref>; Scheiffarth <ref>2003</ref>).</p>
				<p>The long migratory journeys between widely separated wintering and breeding areas
					require several refuelling stops en route. The ‘jumping’ and ‘skipping’
					migration strategies are characterized by long flights with one or few stops
					in-between (Piersma <ref>1987</ref>). The alternative strategy, ‘hopping’ (i.e.
					flying short distances between frequent stops), is energetically cheaper than
					performing long jumps or intermediate skips (Piersma <ref>1987</ref>). Whereas
					hoppers should be expected to show little variation in body condition during
					stopovers, jumpers should arrive at a staging site in a fat-depleted condition.
					In comparison to hoppers, jumpers have to stay longer at stopovers to refuel and
					to depart with higher levels of reserves for the next long-distance bout. In
					this case, a negative correlation between fat loads upon arrival at a stopover
					site and length of stay should exist. The missing relationship between fat
					stores and stopover duration among birds captured at Hohenau indicates that Wood
					Sandpipers follow a ‘hopping’ migration strategy, as has been suggested for the
					autumn passage of this species (Meissner <ref>1997</ref>; Wichmann et al.
						<ref>2004</ref>). This assumption is further confirmed by the comparison of
					mean body masses of birds captured at Hohenau with data found in the literature.
					After crossing the Mediterranean Sea, the body masses of spring migrants
					increase during the course of their northbound journey.</p>
				<p>Overall, earlier birds tended to have lower fat stores than later migrants, but a
					significant increase in fat deposits could only be recorded in temporary
					residents. Birds arriving at Hohenau earlier in the season thus exhibited lower
					fat stores and stayed at Hohenau longer than later temporary residents, which
					carried larger fat deposits and stopped over only for a short time. The reasons
					for the shorter stopovers recorded in later temporarily resident migrants may be
					twofold. The first is that the time pressure to arrive at breeding grounds on
					time in order to obtain a high-quality territory, mate and complete the breeding
					cycle presumably increases as the season progresses. Spring migrants earlier in
					the season may have the ‘luxury' to stay longer and encounter variable
					environmental conditions in a fairly flexible manner. The second is that later
					migrants may have used other sites for refuelling, as indicated by the
					relatively larger fat deposits in birds arriving later in the season, and thus
					stayed in Hohenau only for a short time. Since fat stores of transients and
					temporary residents were similar, even after accounting for the progress of the
					season, we assume that Wood Sandpipers may exhibit individual variability in
					migration strategy and the use of stopover sites (Iverson et al.
					<ref>1996</ref>; Meissner <ref>1997</ref>; Remisiewicz et al. <ref>2007</ref>),
					as reflected by variation in the residency patterns and body condition of birds
					captured at Hohenau.</p>
				<p>The short-hop migration strategy emphasizes the importance of maintaining a
					network of abundant wetlands along the migration route. Being wetland
					specialists, Wood Sandpipers, as well as many other waders migrating through or
					breeding in continental wetlands, are highly dependent on the preservation of
					these habitats. During the last few decades, wetlands in Europe have drastically
					declined (van Vessem et al. <ref>1997</ref>). The Hohenau sugar factory was
					closed in the year after our study was conducted; the Auring Society (a local
					non-governmental organization) has since struggled to maintain the Absetzbecken
					as artificial wetlands for waders and waterfowl. Small disjunct patches of
					temporally dynamic wetlands provide less predictable resources than large
					permanent wetlands or coastal intertidal areas. The latter in particular
					accommodate many species that show consistent year-to-year use of traditional
					staging posts. For jumpers, the loss of only one site could cause a net
					reduction of the entire population if feeding and resting areas become too far
					apart. In contrast, hoppers may be capable of locating habitats
					opportunistically (Skagen and Knopf <ref>1993</ref>, <ref>1994</ref>) and may
					better be able to cope with the loss of a few individual sites. However, the
					summation of the effects, which in our case would result from the loss of
					several suitable inland wetlands, has proven to be one of the major problems
					encountered in nature conservation (EEA <ref>2006</ref>). While stopover sites
					that traditionally support large populations during migration have received the
					most recognition, complexes of small wetlands have often been neglected by
					recent conservation efforts. Yet the existence of an adequate density of small
					freshwater stopover sites must be ensured for those long-distance migrants
					depending on a continuous network of wetland habitats as stepping stones along
					their migratory route.</p>

					<head>Zugdynamik und geschlechtsspezifische Muster im Rastverhalten des

					<p>Als nahezu monomorphe Limikolenart wurden geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede
						in der Zugstrategie des Bruchwasserläufers bisher kaum untersucht. Wir
						fingen Frühjahrszieher an einem wichtigen Rastplatz in den March-Thaya—Auen
						im nordöstlichen Niederösterreich und markierten sie individuell mit
						Farbringen. Die molekulare Geschlechtsbestimmung von 80 Individuen erfolgte
						anhand von Schwanzfederproben. Unter jenen Vögeln, die nach dem Fangtag
						erneut im Gebiet gesichtet wurden (“temporary residents”) zogen Männchen
						durchschnittlich 3 Tage früher als Weibchen. Da jedoch weder bezüglich
						Fettdepots, Verweildauer noch des Anteils an “transients” (Vögel, die nach
						dem Fangtag nicht erneut im Gebiet gesichtet wurden) und <hi rend="italic"
							>temporary residents</hi> geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede
						nachweisbar waren, deuten die gewonnenen Daten darauf hin, dass Männchen und
						Weibchen ähnliche Zugstragien im Frühjahr anwenden. Der hohe Anteil an <hi
							rend="italic">transients</hi> sowie kürzere Verweildauern später
						durchziehender <hi rend="italic">temporary residents</hi> weisen darauf hin,
						dass Bruchwasserläufer in diesem Zugabschnitt Zeit minimieren. Früher
						durchziehende <hi rend="italic">temporary residents</hi> wiesen geringere
						Fettdepots auf als spätere. Nachdem sich jedoch das Ausmaß der angelagerten
						Fettdepots bei “transients” und <hi rend="italic">temporary residents</hi>
						auch unter Berücksichtigung der fortschreitenden Saison ähnelte, vermuten
						wir, dass Bruchwasserläufer eine gewisse individuelle Flexibilität in der
						Zugstrategie und dem Gebrauch von Rastgebieten vor allem früh in der
						Zugsaison an den Tag legen können. Diese Variabilität könnte eine notwendige
						Anpassung sein, um mit möglichen variierenden Umweltbedingungen in
						dynamischen und unvorhersagbaren Binnenland-Rastgebieten zu Rande zu kommen.
						Durch den Vergleich mit Ergebnissen anderer Fangstationen zeigte sich, dass
						das Körpergewicht der Vögel im Laufe ihres Zuges in die nördlichen
						Brutgebiete sukzessive zunimmt. Nach Überquerung des Mittelmeeres werden
						während zahlreicher Zwischenstopps die für die Bewältigung der verbleibenden
						Zugstrecke und das Brutgeschäft notwendigen Energiedepots nach und nach
						aufgebaut. Dem Vorhandensein und der Erhaltung geeigneter Rasthabitate im
						Binnenland kommt damit eine besondere Bedeutung zu.</p>
